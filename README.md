## Requirements 
- The app must be implemented as a native iOS application. Either Swift or Objective-C are acceptable.
- Keep the app lmited to a single screen 
- Buttons to input digits 0-9
- Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction and Division are required operations. 
- Use Closures to handle operations
- Display the current result 
- A way to clear the current result/operation 
- Stack multiple operations (ex: 5 + 2 + 7 - 4 = 10)

## What We Are Looking For

- Clean, well-architected, intuitively-named code.
- Simple User Interface, that fits on multiple iPhone devices. 
- MVC Design 

## Bonus 
- Calculate square root and exponents (5^3 = 125)
- Dark/Light Modes
